# Contributing Guide

## Branching Strategy
- `main`: stable releases
- `develop`: integration branch
- `feature/*`: new work branches created from `develop`

## Issue Workflow
1. Create/assign an issue
2. Create a `feature/*` branch from `develop`
3. Open a Pull Request into `develop`
4. Get at least 1 approval
5. Merge and close the issue

## Pull Request Rules
- No direct push to `main` or `develop`
- At least 1 approving review is required
- Keep PRs small and focused

## Commit Message Style
- Use short, descriptive messages (e.g., `docs: add contributing guide`)
